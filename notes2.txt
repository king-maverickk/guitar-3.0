Based on your areas of concern (areas of concern are, creating realistic noises, real-time audio processing, ability to play multiple notes concurrently, perhaps an option to use the software online, simple but still complex enough to fulfill the goal, MIDI processing), here's a recommendation for a programming language and environment that could be a good fit for your project:

Recommendation: JUCE (C++)

JUCE is a versatile C++ framework that aligns well with your requirements. It's widely used for audio plugin development, real-time audio processing, MIDI processing, and creating interactive audio applications. Here's how JUCE addresses your concerns:

1. Creating Realistic Noises:
   JUCE provides a range of audio synthesis tools, allowing you to create realistic sounds. Its flexible architecture supports various synthesis techniques, including sample-based playback, physical modeling, and wavetable synthesis.

2. Real-Time Audio Processing:
   JUCE is optimized for real-time audio processing, providing low-latency audio input/output capabilities. It offers a high-performance audio engine, making it suitable for applications requiring minimal delay.

3. Ability to Play Multiple Notes Concurrently:
   JUCE allows you to create polyphonic synthesizers and instruments capable of playing multiple notes simultaneously. You can manage polyphony, voice stealing, and other aspects of multi-note playback.

4. Online Use:
   JUCE has the ability to build web-based applications using WebAssembly. This means you can create software that runs directly in web browsers, enabling online usage without requiring users to install anything.

5. Complexity and Fulfilling Goals:
   JUCE strikes a balance between providing a straightforward development experience and offering advanced features for complex audio applications. Its modular architecture lets you tailor your application's complexity to your needs.

6. MIDI Processing:
   JUCE has robust MIDI handling capabilities, allowing you to process MIDI input, create MIDI-based instruments, and respond to MIDI messages for controlling your sounds.

7. Realistic Noises:
   With JUCE's support for various synthesis techniques, you can create realistic guitar sounds using physical modeling or sample-based techniques. JUCE's ability to work with real-time audio allows for dynamic responses to user interactions.

While JUCE offers powerful features, it's important to note that it has a learning curve, especially if you're new to C++ or audio programming. However, its active community, extensive documentation, and example projects can help you get started.

Keep in mind that your choice of tools should align with your personal preferences and experience level. If you're comfortable with C++ and interested in exploring deeper audio programming concepts, JUCE is a strong contender that can meet your project's requirements.
